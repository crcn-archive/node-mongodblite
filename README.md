Inspired by [meteor](http://meteor.com)


### Why?

- I wanted a decoupled library with the same level of functionality provided in [meteor](http://meteor.com)
- Cached on the client-side, and server-side. Less hits to mongodb itself.
- Allows for users to be sandboxed in their own collection (authentication).
